## 🤖 Agent Rules
IMPORTANT: These rules must never be deleted and must be referenced before any action:
1. Always verify file existence before creation using appropriate tools
2. Update this progress file after EVERY significant change:
   - Move completed items to "Completed ✅" section
   - Add new tasks to "Next Steps 📝" section
   - Update "In Progress 🚧" with current tasks
3. Each update must maintain clear tracking of:
   - What was just completed
   - What is currently being worked on
   - What should be done next
4. Never remove completed items - they serve as implementation history

## i18n Translation Feature Progress

### Completed ✅
- Reviewed existing i18n implementation in `lib/i18n` folder

### Review Summary
- The old i18n uses a custom context provider with translation keys and nested objects in `translations.ts`.
- Supports English and French locales with manual locale switching and localStorage persistence.
- Translation function supports parameter replacement.
- Implementation is simpler but lacks advanced i18n features like pluralization, ICU message format, lazy loading, and namespace support.
- Not integrated with i18next or other standard i18n frameworks.

### Next Steps 📝
- Decide whether to keep the old implementation for fallback or remove it.
- Proceed to create new i18n setup using i18next in `src/i18n`.
- Create initial translation JSON files and configure i18next.
- Integrate i18next provider in the app root.
- Start migrating components to use new translation keys.

### In Progress 🚧
